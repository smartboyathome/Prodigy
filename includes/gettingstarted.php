Prodigy is an online learning software that allows people to create classes and collaborate with others to add content. To dive into your new online informal education, click browse and start looking for classes that pique your interest.
<br><br>
You can freely register for Prodigy by clicking on the registration link near the top of the page. By registering, you are enabled to create and edit classes created by others or yourself. Please remember that this website is a shared pool of knowledge, and any form of griefing and immature actions will not be tolerated. After you register, you can log in. After you finish your browsing with Prodigy, you can log out for your own safety, and ours.
<br><br>
If you want to start creating your own classes to share knowledge with others, first log in, and then go to go to the Browsing page. Click the "Create new Class" link to head to the class creation page. Here you will name your class and describe it in a few short words. Afterwards, the class will show up on the class catalog for editing.
<br><br>
Classes will initially be empty, so once you've created your class, you can go to that class page and click "Add Lesson" to add to your class. In the text formatting box, you can use BBCode to format your lesson to your liking, and afterwards click submit to create a new lesson.
<br><br>
If you find that the class name or description, or any of the lessons within the class are misguiding, you can modify them with the modification tools. Simply go to the class editing link within the class page, or the lesson editing link within the correct lesson, and modify the text available.
<br><br>
That covers the basic uses of Prodigy, any further questions you may send an email to the developers. Please keep in mind this page will be updated as we release more features.
